# Changelog

## isoniche 1.1.0

New maintainer: Itai Granot. Author order is now Granot, Dubiner,
Belmaker; Itai Granot and Shahar Dubiner contributed equally.

### Bug fixes

These change results relative to 1.0.0.

- The n-dimensional isodar (`fit_isodars(dim = "ndim")`) is now a line
  (the first principal axis), not a hyperplane (the smallest
  eigenvector) combined with “closest to equal allocation”. The old
  approach biased niche breadth toward generalism.
- Inverse-variance weights (`weights = "1/var"`) were applied twice
  (effectively 1 / sd^4). They are now 1 / (sd^2 (1 + slope^2)), applied
  once.
- `isoderr(output = "SE")` divided the bootstrap standard deviation by
  `sqrt(n_boot)`. The bootstrap SD is itself the standard error, so “SD”
  and “SE” now both return it.
- [`fit_isodars()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/fit_isodars.md)
  no longer recurses forever when an isodar has a negative slope and a
  negative intercept.
- Density-independent niche breadth (`iai(abundances = NULL)`) is now
  evaluated at the first integer total with at least `min_occupancy`
  (default 1) individual in every habitat. Previously the threshold was
  \> 1e-9 individuals. If no total qualifies, one row of `NA` is
  returned.
- `hab_cols = NULL` silently used every column of `data`. Now `hab_cols`
  (or `n_habitats`) is required.

### New features

- A new user-facing layer works on one or many species at once:
  - [`fit_isodars()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/fit_isodars.md)
    accepts long-format data (one row per species x site x habitat,
    columns named by `species`, `site`, `habitat`, `abundance` and
    optionally `effort`) and returns one fit per species
    (`isodar_fits`). Counts are converted to densities per
    `reference_effort` (default: the median effort). The wide-format
    interface is unchanged.
  - [`niche_breadth()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/niche_breadth.md)
    returns, per species, density-independent and density-dependent
    niche breadth with site-bootstrap confidence intervals, the
    spillover abundance (the total at which the least-favoured used
    habitat reaches one individual), preference-reversal abundances,
    abandoned habitats and diagnostic flags as columns. Printing it
    gives one summary line and the unit of abundance. Density-dependent
    niche breadth is by default the limit at infinite abundance
    (`dependent_at = "asymptote"`), computed directly. The flags include
    a test of whether isodar intercepts differ from sampling noise
    (multinomial null model, as in the paper). With `seed`, each species
    gets its own random streams, and the user’s random-number state is
    restored afterwards.
  - [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) of a
    [`niche_breadth()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/niche_breadth.md)
    result counts the species with estimates and without warning flags,
    gives quartiles of the estimates and, for each flag raised, how many
    species raised it, what it means and what to do about it.
  - [`iai_curve()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/iai_curve.md)
    and its [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)
    method give niche breadth as a function of total abundance, with
    bootstrap bands, each species’ density-independent value and
    asymptote, preference reversals, and the totals at which two
    species’ curves cross. The curve is drawn thinner beyond the largest
    observed site total, the x-axis gives the unit of abundance, and the
    legend avoids the curves.
    [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) of a
    [`niche_breadth()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/niche_breadth.md)
    result plots its curves.
  - [`community_to_long()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/community_to_long.md)
    converts a community matrix (samples x species) and a table of
    sample attributes into the long format, pooling samples from the
    same site and habitat and summing their effort.
  - [`check_coverage()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/check_coverage.md)
    summarises sampling coverage per species and habitat;
    [`group_sites()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/group_sites.md)
    merges nearby sites (complete linkage on great-circle distance,
    summing counts and efforts);
    [`radius_sensitivity()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/radius_sensitivity.md)
    shows how results change with the grouping radius.
  - [`fit_isodars()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/fit_isodars.md)
    and
    [`niche_breadth()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/niche_breadth.md)
    warn when the data have an effort column that is not used, and
    `reference_effort` without an `effort` column is an error.
- [`simulate_isodars()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/simulate_isodars.md)
  simulates any number of habitats (`slopes`, `intercepts`), optional
  missing habitats (`p_missing`) and long-format output; the
  three-habitat default gives the same numbers as before.
- New data set `moorea_fish`: reef fishes of Moorea in three habitats
  (the paper’s Table S2).
- New vignettes:
  [`vignette("isoniche")`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/articles/isoniche.md)
  (get started),
  [`vignette("data-preparation")`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/articles/data-preparation.md),
  [`vignette("diagnostics")`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/articles/diagnostics.md)
  and
  [`vignette("method")`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/articles/method.md);
  `citation("isoniche")`; a pkgdown website.
- Habitats a species never uses are handled.
  [`fit_isodars()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/fit_isodars.md)
  (and
  [`isoderr()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/isoderr.md))
  gain `absent = "auto"`, which declares a habitat absent when the
  species has no more than `absent_max_count` (default 0) records in it
  across at least `absent_min_sites` (default 5) sites where it was
  present in another habitat. Absent habitats are excluded from the
  isodar fit, fixed at 0, and counted as 0 in the inequality, so they
  lower niche breadth. Previously such habitats broke the fit and
  [`iai()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/iai.md)
  returned `NA`. Habitats with no records but fewer informative sites
  give a warning and are kept. Use `absent = "none"` for the old
  behaviour or name habitats directly. A species that uses a single
  habitat has niche breadth 0.
  [`isoderr()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/isoderr.md)
  decides the absent set once, on the full data. Results for species
  that use every habitat are unchanged.
- Scaled niche breadth is kept within \[0, 1\] (rounding error could
  give values such as -1e-16).
- New
  [`pairwise_niche()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/pairwise_niche.md)
  summarises pairwise isodars into niche breadth indices (paper, revised
  Appendix S1). By default (`scale = "log"`) the indices do not depend
  on which habitat of each pair is on the x-axis: slope deviations are
  `log(b)^2` and intercept deviations use the perpendicular distance of
  the isodar from the origin, `abs(a) / sqrt(1 + b^2)`; it returns the
  inverse root-mean-square deviations and the weighted means of
  `abs(log(b))` and of that distance, with optional weights (`"1/var"`,
  the inverse perpendicular residual variance, or numeric). Isodars with
  non-positive slopes are left out of the slope indices with a warning.
  `$cycles` checks consistency: the product of the slopes around each
  cycle of three habitats, which should be 1, flagged beyond
  `cycle_tolerance`. `scale = "linear"` gives the earlier indices (mean
  intercept and slope, deviations `(b - 1)^2` and `a^2`); `log_slope` is
  a deprecated alias.
- Pairwise isodars use every site where both habitats of a pair were
  recorded, so sites that lack some habitats still contribute.
- `fit_isodars(dim = "ndim", ndim_method = "latent")` estimates the line
  from incomplete sites (every site with at least two habitats) as a
  one-factor model fitted with glmmTMB, and checks that the habitats are
  connected through shared sites. `ndim_method = "auto"` picks `"pca"`
  when all sites are complete and `"latent"` otherwise.
- [`fit_isodars()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/fit_isodars.md)
  returns classed tibbles (`isodars_pairwise`, `isodar_line`).
- [`iai()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/iai.md)
  allocates abundance among habitats by weighted least squares on the
  pairwise isodar equations, constrained to the total and to
  non-negative abundances, solved exactly by an active-set method.
  (Setting negative habitats to 0 and re-solving, as first implemented,
  could miss the optimum when a habitat dropped early should have been
  kept. For the 325 species of `moorea_fish`, no density-independent
  value or spillover abundance changes, and no value in the paper’s
  reference table; density-dependent niche breadth rises slightly for 3
  species at the asymptote, by at most 0.014, and for 1 species at a
  total of 1000, by 0.002.) When the isodars do not determine the
  allocation (for example, a habitat without records was kept),
  [`iai()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/iai.md) says so
  instead of failing with “singular matrix”.
- `isoderr(output = "CI")` returns percentile bootstrap intervals.
- [`iai()`](https://itai811.github.io/isoniche/reference/iai.md) gives
  an informative error when `abundances` contains `NA`, non-finite or
  negative values.
- Unit tests cover the paper’s reference values, a simulation with a
  known answer, each bug fix above, input validation and the latent
  method.
