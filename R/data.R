#' Reef fishes of Moorea in three habitats
#'
#' Counts of 325 reef fish species in three reef habitats at 13 sites around
#' Moorea, French Polynesia: the data of Granot, Dubiner & Belmaker (Table S2).
#' Fish were counted on belt transects by CRIOBE between 2004 and 2018; there
#' is one count per species, site and habitat. Only sites where
#' a species was recorded are included for that species; all three habitats
#' were surveyed at every site, and zeros are explicit.
#'
#' @format A tibble with one row per species x site x habitat:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{species}{Species name.}
#'   \item{site}{Site (13 sites).}
#'   \item{habitat}{`"barrier_reef"`, `"fringing_reef"` or `"outer_slope"`.}
#'   \item{abundance}{Number of individuals counted.}
